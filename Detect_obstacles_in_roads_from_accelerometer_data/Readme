Detection of obstacles in the roads using XYZ data

i) PROBLEM DEFINITION

BMS wants to detect obstacles on the roads utilizing XYZ axis data from the accelerometer of the units installed in the moving vehicles. 
These detections will be used for the development for a digital twin platform where BMS is planning to monitor the state of bad potholes / speed bumps / etc.  
and provide data solutions in road authorities and municipalities where they can prioritize the fixing of obstacles 
that are causing dangerous events or accidents in the roads

Potential objects to detect are listed below:
i) potholes
ii) speed bumps
iii) manholes
iv) cracks in the roads
v) etc.

It is not expected that the candidate will manage to detect all of the above categories but should rather focus on one or two of them with a higher priority
the potholes and speed bumps

ii) DATA UNDERSTANDING

The XYZ dataset contains 10hz measurements of the accelerometer of a single vehicle for one day.
